# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles.

# Origin

I started with [@justone](http://github.com/justone)'s [dfm](http://github.com/justone/dfm) and dotfiles many years ago. At this point I have mostly only kept `dfm` and reworked my entire configuration over the years.

It is now primarily zsh, zplug, with neovim (using a lightly modified LazyVim) and some additional utilities and configs for things I use.

# Structure

To use the same structure for yourself, start with the barebones version of the [master branch of the dotfiles repo](http://github.com/justone/dotfiles).
